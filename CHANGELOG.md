# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

* Updated to `automerge@0.12.0`.
* `Dialer` now has an associated `Error` type, and `Dialer::connect` returns
  `DialError<Self::Error>` to distinguish transient and permanent failures.
* `DialerHandle` and `DialerFailed` are now generic over the dialer's error
  type. `DialerFailed` is now an enum distinguishing exhausted retries from a
  user-defined permanent failure.
* Added `DialerEvent::PermanentFailure`

### Added

* `Dialer::connect` can return a `DialError::PermanentFailure` to indicate
  that samod should not retry connection. This error is returned to listeners
  on `DialerHandle::established`

## 0.13.0 - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

* FileSystemStorage now limits the number of file descriptors it opens to 500

### Breaking Changes

* Updated to `automerge@0.11.0`

## 0.12.3 - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

* `FileSystemStorage` no longer panics if the filesystem is not shaped the way
  it expects.

## 0.12.2 - 2026-07-08

### Added

* Added `DocHandle::with_document_async` which does two things:
  a) Does not block the current task waiting to acquire the underlying document
    mutex
  b) In threadpool mode runs the closure on the threadpool so that slow
     automerge operations don't block the calling task

## 0.12.1 - 2026-06-22

### Changed

* `DocHandle::{changes, ephemeral}` now return streams with a `'static`
   lifetime

## 0.12.0 - 2026-06-05

### Breaking Changes

* Updated to `automerge@0.10.0`.

## 0.11.0 - 2026-06-04

### Breaking Changes

The only breaking change here is that the `samod-core` crate has updated to
0.11.0. This doesn't change the API for `samod` really but we do re-export
some `samod-core` types and so it is a breaking change.

### Added

* Added `Repo::search`, which returns an initial `SearchState` and a stream of
  subsequent search state updates for a document lookup. This lets applications
  distinguish between loading from storage, requesting from peers, currently
  unavailable, and found states. Importantly `Repo::search` continues notifying
  even if the document is not found so that you can wait until someone does
  have it (e.g. if you are waiting for a network connection to come up).
* Added `SearchState` and peer request status reporting so callers can inspect
  which connected peers have been requested, are syncing, are unavailable, or
  have the document available.

### Changed

* `Repo::find` is now implemented as a convenience wrapper around `Repo::search`.
  Its public API remains unchanged.

### Fixed

* Fixed a regression where `Repo::find` could hang instead of returning
  `Ok(None)` after connected peers reported that a document was unavailable.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-05-15

### Breaking Changes

* Updated to `automerge@0.9.0`

### Fixed

* A bug which causes sync time to increase exponentially with the total number
  of connections since samod started

## 0.9.0 - 2026-03-25

### Breaking Changes

* Updated to `automerge@0.8.0`

### Fixed

* A bug where locally unavailable documents sent by peers with an announce
  policy set to false would be marked as unavailable

### Added

* `TcpDialer::new` which takes a `Url` parameter, rather than a host and a port
  or a socket address.
* `Repo::dial_tcp()` to simplify construction of `TcpDialer`. 
* Allow documents syncing over the TCP transport to be up to 8gb size instead
  of Tokio's default 8mb frame size
* Exposed receiving `ConnectionHandle`s via `accept()`. Users can now subscribe
  to an `events()` stream directly on the handle, or `await` for
  `handshake_completed()`.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-03-06

The main focus of this release is a new connection management API which
replaces the `Repo::connect` method with separate APIs for making outgoing
connections (referred to as a "dialer") and accepting incoming connections
(an "acceptor"). The payoff is that we can automatically handle reconnection.

A second, smaller feature is the addition of a `RepoObserver` to help with
monitoring running `samod` processes.

What follows is a quick guide to the new connections API; for more details on
breaking changes and other added features, see the "Added" and "Breaking
Changes" sections which follow the guide.

### Updating to the New Connection API

#### Outgoing connections (previously `Repo::connect(..., ConnDirection::Outgoing)`)

```rust
// Before
let conn = repo.connect(rx, tx, ConnDirection::Outgoing).unwrap();
conn.handshake_complete().await.unwrap();

// After
let handle = repo.dial(BackoffConfig::default(), Arc::new(my_dialer)).unwrap();

// or, for WebSocket URLs directly:
let handle = repo.dial_websocket(url, BackoffConfig::default()).unwrap();
```

#### Incoming connections (previously `Repo::connect(..., ConnDirection::Incoming)`)

```rust
// Before
let conn = repo.connect(rx, tx, ConnDirection::Incoming).unwrap();

// After — set up an acceptor once, then hand transports to it as they arrive:
let acceptor = repo.make_acceptor(url).unwrap();

// From arbitrary streams/sinks:
acceptor.accept(Transport::new(rx_stream, tx_sink)).unwrap();

// From an axum WebSocket upgrade handler:
acceptor.accept_axum(socket).unwrap();

// From a raw tungstenite stream:
acceptor.accept_tungstenite(ws_stream).unwrap();
```

#### Observing connection events

```rust
// Dialer side — wait for the first successful connection:
let peer_info = handle.established().await?;

// Dialer side — stream every lifecycle event:
let mut events = handle.events();
while let Some(event) = events.next().await {
    match event {
        DialerEvent::Connected { peer_info } => { /* … */ }
        DialerEvent::Disconnected             => { /* … */ }
        DialerEvent::Reconnecting { attempt } => { /* … */ }
        DialerEvent::MaxRetriesReached        => { break; }
    }
}

// Acceptor side — react to clients connecting/disconnecting:
let mut events = acceptor.events();
while let Some(event) = events.next().await {
    match event {
        AcceptorEvent::ClientConnected    { connection_id, peer_info } => { /* … */ }
        AcceptorEvent::ClientDisconnected { connection_id }            => { /* … */ }
    }
}
```

#### Implementing a custom `Dialer`

```rust
use samod::{Dialer, Transport};
use url::Url;
use std::pin::Pin;

struct MyDialer { url: Url }

impl Dialer for MyDialer {
    fn url(&self) -> Url { self.url.clone() }

    fn connect(&self) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<Transport, Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>>> + Send>> {
        Box::pin(async move {
            // establish your transport here, then wrap it:
            Ok(Transport::new(my_rx_stream, my_tx_sink))
        })
    }
}
```

#### Implementing `RuntimeHandle::sleep`

If you have a custom `RuntimeHandle`, add the new required method:

```rust
fn sleep(&self, duration: Duration) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + Send {
    tokio::time::sleep(duration) // or your runtime's equivalent
}
```

### Added

* `Repo::dial` — initiates an outgoing connection using a user-supplied
  `Dialer` implementation. Returns a `DialerHandle` immediately (non-blocking).
  The `DialerHandle` can be used to monitor the connection.
* `Repo::dial_websocket` — convenience wrapper around `Repo::dial` for
  WebSocket connections; takes a `Url` and `BackoffConfig`.
* `Repo::acceptor` — registers a URL as a listening address and returns an
  `AcceptorHandle` for accepting incoming connections on that URL.
* `Transport` — a type-erased `(Stream, Sink)` pair returned by `Dialer::connect`
  and accepted by `AcceptorHandle::accept`.
* `RuntimeHandle::sleep` — required new method on the `RuntimeHandle` trait;
  must return a future that completes after the given `Duration`. This powers
  back-off delays inside the reconnection logic.
* `samod::NeverAnnounce`, an `AnnouncePolicy` which never announces any documents
  to peers
* Add the `native-tls` feature to `tungstenite` and `tokio-tungstenite` when the
  `tungstenite` feature is enabled. This allows using TLS with WebSocket 
  dialers.
* The `samod::tokio_io` module which contains `TcpDialer` for connecting to 
  servers over TCP and `AcceptorHandle::accetp_tokio_io` which implements
  the receiving end
* `samod::RepoObserver` which is notified of events occurring in the `Repo`
  which may be of interest for monitoring (e.g. for producing throughput
  statistics on sync message processing)

### Fixed

* A bug where requests which were forwarded across peers who were configured
  to not announce documents would fail to resolve on the original requestor
* Some interoperability bugs with the JS implementation
* A bug where if a connection failed during establishment the io loop would
  crash, causing the whole repo to stop working

### Breaking Changes

* **`Repo::connect` / `Connection` removed.** The old unified `connect` method
  and the `Connection` / `ConnDirection` types have been removed entirely.
  Use `Repo::dial` (outgoing) and `Repo::acceptor` + `AcceptorHandle::accept`
  (incoming) instead.
* **`RuntimeHandle::sleep` is now required.** Any custom `RuntimeHandle`
  implementation must add a `sleep(duration: Duration) -> impl Future` method.
* **`Repo::connect_tungstenite` / `Repo::accept_axum` / `Repo::accept_tungstenite`
  moved to `AcceptorHandle`.** Call `acceptor.accept_axum(socket)` /
  `acceptor.accept_tungstenite(ws)` instead of the repo directly.
* **`Repo::when_connected` removed.** Replace calls like
  `repo.when_connected(peer_id).await` with `dialer_handle.established().await`
  (dialer side) or listening on `acceptor.events()` for
  `AcceptorEvent::ClientConnected` (acceptor side). Connection IDs are now
  obtained from those futures/events rather than from `when_connected`.
* **`load_local` replaces `load` on `LocalPool` repos.** `RepoBuilder::load_local()`
  must be used instead of `RepoBuilder::load()` when building a repo for a
  `futures::executor::LocalPool` runtime.


## samod-core: 0.7.1 - 2026-01-13

### Added

* Added `DocumentActor::begin_modification` method for modification patterns
  which can't be expressed using a callback

## 0.7.1 - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

* There was a bug where document larger than 8Mb wouldn't sync due to a size
  limit in the length delimited codec used in `Repo::connect_tokio_io`. This
  has been fixed by increasing the limit

## 0.7.0 - 2026-01-07

### Breaking Changes

* `Repo::connected_peers` now returns a stream of changes to the connected
  peers, as well as the currently connected peers. This makes it possible to
  track changes to connected peers consistently

### Fixed

* Fixed a deadlock when using ConcurrencyConfig::Threadpool and loading more
  documents than threads in the pool

## 0.6.1 - 2025-12-08

### Added

* impl `PartialEq` and `Eq` for `AutomergeUrl`

### Fixed

* samod: Use doc_cfg instead of doc_auto_cfg to make docs.rs build work

## 0.6.0 - 2025-12-05

This release is a reasonably chunky change to the API of `samod`. Instead
of having `Repo::connect` return a future which needs to be driven, `Repo::connect`
now handles the connection on the runtime it was created with and returns a
`Connection` object, which can be used to examine the connection.

### Added

* `Repo::connect` is now synchronous and returns a `Connection` object
* `DocHandle::{we_have_their_changes, they_have_our_changes}` methods for 
  waiting for sync to complete
* `DocHandle::peers` for listening to changes to the state of peers connected
  to a given document
* `AutomergeUrl::document_id`

### Breaking Changes

* `Repo::connect` is now synchronous and returns a `Connection` object. This 
  means that where previously you would spawn a future here, you can now just
  call the method and forget about the connection (unless you want it for
  some reason)

## 0.5.1 - 2025-12-02

### Added 

* `From<u32>` and `Into<u32>` impls for  `samod_core::{CommandId, IoTaskId,
  ConnectionId, DocumentActorId}`
* `Clone` implementations for various `samod_core` types
* `DocumentId::as_bytes`
* `UnixTimestamp::from_millis`

### Updated

* Updated to `automerge` 0.7.1

## 0.5.0 - 2025-10-03

### Changed

* `AutomergeUrl` is now clone (thanks to @pkgw)

### Breaking Changes

* Updated to `automerge` 0.7.0

## 0.4.0 - 2025-09-15

### Added

* It is now possible to use `Storage` and `AnnouncePolicy` implementations which
  can't support `Send` futures. This is enabled by implementing the new
  `LocalStorage` and `LocalAnnouncePolicy` traits instead of `Storage` and
  `AnnouncePolicy`. and loading the repo using a `LocalRuntimeHandle` rather
  than a `RuntimeHandle`.

### Breaking Changes

* Use of a `rayon` threadpool to run document actors is now gated behind the
  `threadpool` feature flag and the `RepoBuilder::with_concurrency` method.
* `RuntimeHandle` is now much simpler and only requires a `spawn`function
* `StorageKey` no longer implements `FromIterator<String>` or
  `From<Vec<String>>`, use `StorageKey::from_parts` instead

## 0.3.1 - 2025-08-29

### Fixed

* It was possible for the compaction logic to completely delete a document in
  some cases, fixed in https://github.com/alexjg/samod/pull/19

## 0.3.0 - 2025-08-25

### Added

* Added a `RuntimeHandle` for a `futures::executor::LocalPool`
* Add `Repo::connect_tokio_io` as a convenience for connecting a
  `tokio::io::Async{ReadWrite}` source as a length delimited stream/sink
  combination
* Added a bunch of docs

### Breaking Changes

* Rename `samod::Samod` to `samod::Repo` and `samod::SamodBuilder` to `samod::RepoBuilder`

## 0.2.2 - 2025-08-18

This release is a significant rewrite of the `samod_core` crate to not use
async/await syntax internally. It introduces no changes to `samod` but there
are breaking changes in `samod_core`:

### Breaking Changes to `samod_core`

* `samod_core::ActorResult` is now called `samod_core::DocActorResult` and has
  an additional `stopped` field
* `Hub::load` no longer takes a `rand::Rng` or `UnixTimestamp` argument
* `SamodLoader::step` takes an additional `rand::Rng` argument
* `SamodLoader::provide_io_result` no longer takes a `UnixTimestamp` argument
* `Hub::handle_event` takes an additional `rand::Rng` argument

## 0.2.1 - 2025-08-08

### Fixed

* Fix a deadlock

## 0.2.0 - 2025-08-06

### Fixed

* Make `samod_core::Hub` and `samod_core::SamodLoader` `Send` ([#3](https://github.com/alexjg/samod/pull/3) by @matheus23)
